# Info

This repository contains **obsolete, legacy WordPress themes** created by WebMan Design before year 2015. These themes were deprecated and [removed from distribution on 1st June 2015](https://www.facebook.com/webmandesigneu/posts/975621742461627).


## Important

### End of updates

Please understand that **we no longer provide updates for these themes**. They are build upon old standards and code framework and we strongly advice to upgrade to newer, modern and flexible themes (see below). 

### Premium plugins included with the themes

Premium plugins, originally distributed with these themes in the past, are **no longer contained within theme ZIP files**. This is to prevent any copyright and licensing issues. Thank you for understanding!


## Upgrade

[WebMan Design](https://www.webmandesign.eu/) has upgraded coding framework according to WordPress standards and requirements and our new WordPress themes [comply to these standards 100%](http://themecheck.org/score/wordpress-theme-icelander-v1_0_0.html).

We are now focusing on building **accessibility ready** themes, making your website available to the widest possible audience. Also, all of our new themes are licensed fully under GPL and they don't suffer from lock-in effect.

Please note though, that due to all of these changes to our approach, our new themes are not compatible with any of these legacy themes and there is no easy way to upgrade. You can surely use plugins to [convert any custom post type](https://wordpress.org/plugins/convert-post-types/) and [custom taxonomy](https://wordpress.org/plugins/taxonomy-converter/), but it would be probably easier to rebuild your website anew as no legacy shortcodes used in these themes are compatible with any current page builder elements/blocks/modules.

Website and WordPress themes (ThemeForest) building standards have moved miles from those old unfortunate days. **All of our new themes are coded to be as future proof as possible.**

Thank you for understanding and sorry for any inconvenience caused!
